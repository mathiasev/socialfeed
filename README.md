#Stack#

A new social feed aggregator
=========

This is the way it usually goes:
1. You open Social App #1
2. You scroll through this app until you either: 1, get bored, or 2, reach the place you've been before
3. You then close this app, and switch to the next one.

What if we made it easier?

*Stack takes all your social apps, and pulls them together.*

Not only that, you actually get to see what your friends are posting, not what we think you 'may like based on your recent activity'.
